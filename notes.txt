11/11/20

- 'Chine' too broad word, may work on 'masque' instead
- tweets are between 3/10/20 - 11/10/20
- Is good practice to remove ppl with few fav and friends? (bots ans silencious majority)
- Louvain gave ~50 partitions, remove not connected parts, subgraphs had relevant communities
- Is it possible to make graph with NLP, node = person that tweet and edge = cosine sim of tweets
- How to analyse further the graphs, other than manually look at pple in them?
- Are the number of partitions too large or is it ok?
