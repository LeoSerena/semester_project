TODO
- scrap html links
- name resolution from @
- cross-reference
- k-means
- full pipeline with keras for the model

QUESTIONS
- need tweets and comments of tweets
- web scraping, twiter redirecting to other links
- how to do NER with @ and usernames?
- spacy needs annotated dataset to be trained on to do coreference resolution...
- How to review cluster and analyse them?
- model: difference between k-means and cosine similarity in model

- 'Chine' too broad word, may work on 'masque' instead
- tweets are between 3/10/20 - 11/10/20
- Is good practice to remove ppl with few fav and friends? (bots ans silencious majority)
- Louvain gave ~50 partitions, remove not connected parts, subgraphs had relevant communities
- Is it possible to make graph with NLP, node = person that tweet and edge = cosine sim of tweets
- How to analyse further the graphs, other than manually look at pple in them?
- Are the number of partitions too large or is it ok?

EVALUATING EMBEDDINGS

https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1036.pdf

two evaluation types

intrinsic: tasks of preselected set of query terms and semantically related target words = query inventory.
           Then weighted evaluation of these tasks 
extrinsic: embeddings as input of a task and evaluate them wrt this task (like PoS or NER).

Absolute intrinsic evaluations:
    - Relatedness: if relatedness scores for words is big -> cosine sim should be high for them
    - Analogy : find y for x such that their relationship is like a given a and b.
    - Categorization : cluster words and compare with labeled clusters
    - Selectional preference : determine how typical a noun is for a verb as the subject or as the verb complement.
                               ie 'people eat' more sensible than 'eat people'.
